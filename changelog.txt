= v.1.2.4 (in git)
* The map may now request a URL for a specified image format. As an exampe, set map.format = :jpg to get smaller images (but also less quality).
* You can now request different map types, like satellite, hybrid, terrain etc.
* The marker has no responsibility for it's location any more. It hands off the work to Location object if it is asked for anything related to Location.

* It is no longer needed to send in key, sensor and size to the Map's constructor as long as these values are set on GoogleStaticMapsHelper.
