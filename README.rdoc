= Google Static Maps Helper

This gem provides a simple interface to the Google Static Maps V2 API (http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/staticmaps/)

== Marker
A marker object is, not surprisingly, representing a marker in the Google static map. It is pushed into the Map object and is used
to generate the URL for the static map. Markers which are of the same "type" (same color, label and size) are grouped together in the generated URL
so that we obey the schema of URL which Google has defined as "markers=markerStyles|markerLocation1|markerLocation2|... etc."

=== How to build a Marker?
The easiest way to build a marker is by simply sending in an object which responds to lng and lat, or
by sending lng and lat in as a hash.
  marker = GoogleStaticMapsHelper::Marker.new(location)
  marker = GoogleStaticMapsHelper::Marker.new(:lng => 1, :lat => 2)

Google's static maps supports some options on markers. You can change the color, the label and the size.
(http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/staticmaps/#MarkerStyles). You send in options as a second
parameter to the new method if you gave a location object, or include it in the hash where lng and lat is.
  marker = GoogleStaticMapsHelper::Marker.new(location, :color => 'blue')
  marker = GoogleStaticMapsHelper::Marker.new(:lng => 1, :lat => 2, :color => 'blue')


== Map
A Map holds many markers, pluss some additional options like the size of the static image, Google key, what zoom level and center point it should be fixed to
etc. If no zoom or center point is give it will calculate the map view based on the markers. You can leave markers out, but then you have to supply
zoom and center. More info can be found here: http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/staticmaps/#URL_Parameters

=== How to build a map?
When building a map object you have to supply key, sensor and size. Other options are optional.
  map = GoogleStaticMapsHelper::Map.new(:key => YOUR_GOOGLE_KEY, :sensor => false, :size => '200x300')


== Generate static map URL
With the map object made, we are ready to add some markers to it:
  map << marker
  map << another_marker

We can now ask the map for it's URL to where we'll get the requested map from. This URL can be used as src attribute on an image tag.
  map.url

Another thing you might want to do is to override the center point and zoom level. This is done during map construction
  map = GoogleStaticMapsHelper::Map.new(:key => YOUR_GOOGLE_KEY,
                                        :sensor => false,
                                        :size => '200x300',
                                        :center => '1,2',
                                        :zoom => 4)
