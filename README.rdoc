This gem provides a simple interface to the Google Static Maps V2 API (http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/staticmaps/)


== Marker
A marker object is, not surprisingly, representing a marker in the Google static map. It is pushed into the Map object and is used
to generate the URL for the static map.

A marker is built as following:
The easiest way to build a marker is by simply sending in an object which responds to lng and lat, or
by sending lng and lat in as a hash.
  GoogleStaticMapsHelper::Marker.new(location)
  GoogleStaticMapsHelper::Marker.new(:lng => 1, :lat => 2)

Google's static maps supports some options on markers. You can change the color, the lable and the size.
(http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/staticmaps/#MarkerStyles). You send in options as a second
parameter to the new method, or include it in the has where lng and lat is.
  GoogleStaticMapsHelper::Marker.new(location, :color => 'blue')
  GoogleStaticMapsHelper::Marker.new(:lng => 1, :lat => 2, :color => 'blue')
